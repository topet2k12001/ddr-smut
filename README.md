<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Background and Motivation

Working on modding DDR involves a lot of repetitive tasks/actions involving diffrent utilities and tools, so I automated them using "scripts" that cater to my own workflows/tasks. Time went on and I now have quite a number of these "scripts." Doing all of this "modding work" isn't really something that I intended to do; it just so happened that COVID-19 came so the arcades are closed, and I was itching to really play the game. I got free time on my hands, so I stumbled upon website after website, forum after forum, and chat group after chat group...learning here and there.

So here I am now! I could say that I've gone a long way for someone without a programming background (I'm VERY...VERY, GOOD at MS Excel though if that counts!).

I didn't make those sophisticated tools (and I'm amazed at the people behind these tools!) but at least, modesty aside, I was able to:

* fork, make some minor modifications, and build [my own local e-Amusement emulated server](https://github.com/topet2k12001/butterfly)
* build RhythmCodex on my own (yes, the version that can produce the "file" in the "proper format" if you know what I mean)
* make these wonderful scripts that help make modding so much fun and easier for me
* learn how to extract/rip stuff (and find the "blocks" or "chunks" needed to be entered)
* figuring out at a "layman's level" the highly-technical documents about SSQs and making a calculator out of it (I created a calculator that can tell me EXACTLY where/what to edit in hex, if you know what I mean)
* ...and so much more!

In short, I have achieved "independence" at some level, in terms of doing all of this, at least to my satisfaction. I know that my "achievements" or "feats" may be trivial for those of you who have proper programming education/background, but I'm still proud of what I have accomplished given the odds. :smile:

On the other hand, I don't see myself as doing this for an extended period of time. As I said, I'm not a programmer so while this is fun, it is not my passion. Although it is true that now I can do all of this on my own IF/WHEN I want to, at the end of the day I'm just another DDR Player wanting to play and I was just forced to learn all of this due to circumstances.

I am anticipating that my "real-world" busy life will be taking over my free time sooner or later. The "real-life" version of myself is a very busy person with no time for learning things like this. With that said, I think the time is ripe for me to put this out to share.

### Project Proper

This repository is all about sharing my actual automation scripts, and **NOT** the very tools/utilities that my scripts are automating.

***So far, the scripts currently uploaded are:***

1. **DDR F.U.C.K.S. (Fully Unified Converter of Known Songs):** end-to-end process automation of producing a file package for a song in DDR.
2. **DDR S.E.X. ANALYZER (Stepchart Express Analyzer):** this is an automation script for analyzing DDR .ssq stepcharts.
3. **DDR F.A.P. Tool (Final Audio Producer):** this is an automation script to automatically produce the "Final Audio" files (.xwb and .xsb) needed by DDR arcade data, without using the XACT GUI tool.

There are a few more that I will be sharing; please bear with me.

#### Shareable Tools/Utilities
What I **CAN** share/include are **publicly available** tools. When I say "publicly available" I mean, for example:

* Open-source works (e.g. posted publicly in GitHub **AND WITH a license** that allows for sharing)
* Works that are known to be publicly available (e.g. freeware, F.O.S.S.)
* Works whose respective author/s have given express permission to share publicly

#### Non-Shareable Tools/Utilities
What I **CAN NOT** share/include are **semipublicly or privately available** tools/utilities - **even if it means my scripts will fail to function or fail to fully function**:

* Closed-source and/or open-source works e.g. posted publicly in GitHub **BUT WITHOUT a license** (works that have no license are treated by default as copyrighted/not for sharing)
* Works that are known to be privately and/or semipublicly available (e.g. posted and/or shared only in private forum sites and the like)
* Works whose respective author/s have **NOT** given express permission to share publicly

### Built With

* [Batchfile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Create a new folder where we will put the packages (keep the name simple without a space!)
2. Download the `bin` folder [**HERE**](https://mega.nz/folder/dIlngIpK#4nwMwz0PNIZO37_hGISYpg) and put it inside the new folder you just created
3. Download the 7zip Self-Extracting Executable bundle and put it inside the new folder you just created, and double-click to automatically extract
  - [Latest Release](https://github.com/topet2k12001/ddr-smut/releases/latest) page
  - Previous versions are also stored in the [Releases](https://github.com/topet2k12001/ddr-smut/releases) page

**Again, to reiterate:**
- I am only sharing/including those that are **publicly available.** Expect the script to fail to function, or fail to fully function.
- You will have to source the **semipublicly or privately available** tools on your own.
- Where there are sub-folders inside the `bin` folder that I shared, it means that the corresponding tool/utility has to be placed there.

### Prerequisites

I try my best to avoid installation of additional programs/software by converting the tools/utilities whenever possible and practical. However, as a **recommendation,** install the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.9
- [Java](https://java.com/en/) at least Java 8
- [PHP](https://windows.php.net/download/) VC15 builds only

**Notes:**

- **For PHP:** use only versions that say **VC15** (latest version of VC15 build is [version 7.3.27](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-7.3.27-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip)) because I have tested builds based on **VC16** and the tool won't run on it.
- **For Java:** optionally, I have pre-packaged Java which is in the `bin` folder so you won't need to install it anymore. Also if you do install a different version of Java, some of my scripts are still going to make use of the Java version that is packaged in the `bin` folder.
- **For Microsoft DirectX SDK:** [As per Microsoft,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directx-sdk--august-2009-)
  - > The legacy DirectX SDK is no longer available for download from Microsoft Download Center per the retirement of all SHA-1 signed content.
  - Hence you will have to source this on your own as well.

### Installation

There is no need to install my scripts; they are designed as "click-to-run."

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I generally write scripts in a manner that follows a "sequential" logic (e.g. Step 1, Step 2, etc.). Simply run and follow the on-screen instructions. :slightly_smiling_face:
