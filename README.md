<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

**Background**

Working on modding DDR involves a lot of repetitive tasks/actions involving diffrent utilities and tools, so I automated them using "scripts" that cater to my own workflows/tasks. Time went on and I now have quite a number of these "scripts." Doing all of this "modding work" isn't really something that I intended to do; it just so happened that COVID-19 came so the arcades are closed, and I was itching to really play the game. I got free time on my hands, so I stumbled upon website after website, forum after forum, and chat group after chat group...learning here and there.

So here I am now! I could say that I've gone a long way for someone without a programming background (I'm VERY...VERY, GOOD at MS Excel though if that counts!).

I didn't make those sophisticated tools (and I'm amazed at the people behind these tools!) but at least, modesty aside, I was able to:

* fork, make some minor modifications, and build [my own local e-Amusement emulated server](https://github.com/topet2k12001/butterfly)
* build RhythmCodex on my own (yes, the version that can produce the "file" in the "proper format" if you know what I mean)
* make these wonderful scripts that help make modding so much fun and easier for me
* learn how to extract/rip stuff (and find the "blocks" or "chunks" needed to be entered)
* figuring out at a "layman's level" the highly-technical documents about SSQs and making a calculator out of it (I created a calculator that can tell me EXACTLY where/what to edit in hex, if you know what I mean)
* so much more!

In short, I have achieved "independence" at some level, in terms of doing all of this, at least to my satisfaction. :smile:

However, I don't see myself as doing this for an extended period of time. As I said, I'm not a programmer so this is not my passion. While it is true that now I can do all of this on my own IF/WHEN I want to, but at the end of the day I'm just another DDR Player wanting to play and I was just forced to learn all of this due to circumstances.

I am anticipating that my "real-world" busy life will be taking over my free time sooner or later...and with that said, I think the time is ripe for me to put this out to share.

**Project Proper**

This repository is all about sharing my actual automation scripts, and **NOT** the very tools/utilities that my scripts are automating.

I **CAN** share/include **publicly available** tools. When I say "publicly available" I mean, for example:

* Open-source works (e.g. posted publicly in GitHub **AND WITH** a license that allows for sharing)
* Works that are known to be publicly available (e.g. freeware, F.O.S.S.)
* Works where the respective author/s have given express permission to share publicly

I **CAN NOT** share/include **semipublicly available** tools/utilities - **even if it means my scripts will not function or fully function**:

* Closed-source works (e.g. posted publicly in GitHub **AND WITHOUT** a license that allows for sharing)
* Works that are known to be privately and/or semipublicly available (e.g. posted only in private forum sites)
* Works where the respective author/s have given express permission to share publicly
