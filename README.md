# DDR S.M.U.T. (Scripts for Modding Utilities and Tools)

## What is this?

Working on modding DDR involves a lot of repetitive tasks/actions, so I automated them using "scripts" that cater to my own workflows/tasks. Time went on and I now have quite a number of these "scripts." I think it's about time to share them. :)

This repository is all about sharing my actual automation scripts, and **NOT** the very tools/utilities that my scripts are automating.

I can share/include "publicly available" tools. When I say "publicly available" I mean, for example:
* Open-source works (e.g. posted publicly in GitHub)
* Works that are known to be publicly available (e.g. freeware, F.O.S.S.)
  * aadfaf

I can NOT share/include "semipublicly available" tools/utilities

This means you will have to search/find those "semipublicly available" tools/utilities in order to make my scripts fully work. :)

## Why are you sharing?

I'm a busy person and honestly, before I stumbled upon this world of modding/hacking, these things were NEVER my interest. I love the game but I'm not one who will ever spend time doing all of this. Maybe it was just because of the Pandemic that I happen to have the time. But things are getting better, relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and I see myself getting busy with my "real-world" life very soon.

As such, I'd like to put this out in the open and maybe someone will pick these up and continue to improve them.

My only desire, for anyone who will use this, is that you give back. I have licensed my work with Apache 2.0 for this. So, two things:

1. afa
2. afd
